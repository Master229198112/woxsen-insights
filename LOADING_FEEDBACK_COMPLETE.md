## 🔧 Customization (Optional):

### Change Loading Color:
Edit `components/ui/LoadingBar.jsx` - Line 22:
```jsx
ctx.strokeStyle = '#your-color'; // Change from #3b82f6
```

### Change Speed:
Edit `components/ui/LoadingBar.jsx` - Line 36:
```jsx
rotationRef.current = (rotationRef.current + 10) % 360;
// Increase for faster, decrease for slower
```

### Disable Overlay (if preferred):
Comment out lines 97-103 in `LoadingBar.jsx`

## 📊 Performance:

- **Zero delay** on click
- **Minimal overhead** (~1ms)
- **Small bundle** (~3KB)
- **No impact** on load time

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### If favicon doesn't spin:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Clear browser cache

### If loading doesn't show:
- Check if you're using `LoadingLink` component
- Verify LoadingContext is wrapped around app

### If loading doesn't stop:
- System auto-stops after 10 seconds
- Check browser console for errors
