## 📊 Understanding the Stats

```
Total Recipients: 100
Successfully Sent: 25
Failed: 5
Pending: 70
```

- **Total**: All subscribers for this newsletter
- **Successfully Sent**: Emails delivered successfully
- **Failed**: Emails that failed to send
- **Pending**: Not yet attempted

## 🔄 How Resume Works

**Before Resume System:**
```
❌ Sends 25 emails → Server error → STUCK
❌ No way to know which were sent
❌ No way to continue
❌ Either resend all (duplicates) or give up
```

**With Resume System:**
```
✅ Sends 25 emails → Tracked in database
✅ Server error → Tracking preserved
✅ Click "Resume" → Checks database
✅ Only sends to remaining 75 emails
✅ No duplicates!
```

## 📧 Email Batching Timeline

For 100 subscribers:
```
Batch 1: Emails 1-25   (sends immediately)
Wait: 2 minutes
Batch 2: Emails 26-50  (sends after 2 min)
Wait: 2 minutes
Batch 3: Emails 51-75  (sends after 4 min)
Wait: 2 minutes
Batch 4: Emails 76-100 (sends after 6 min)
```

**Total time: ~8 minutes for 100 subscribers**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Sending stops at 25 emails
**Solution**: This is expected! The system sends in batches of 25 with 2-minute delays. Check:
1. Go to Delivery Status page
2. If status shows "Pending" emails, wait or click Resume
3. System will automatically continue

### Problem: "Failed" emails shown
**Possible Causes**:
- Office365 rate limiting
- Invalid email addresses
- Network issues

**Solution**: Click "Resume Sending" - the system will retry failed emails.

### Problem: Can't find Delivery Status page
**Solution**: After sending newsletter, click the notification or navigate to:
```
/admin/newsletter/delivery-status?id=[your_newsletter_id]
```
